1) Interface Vs  Abstract Class
a) Multiple Inheritance supported in Interface
b) Interface used for common functionality Across Unrelated Classes   |  Abstract class is used for common functionality Across Related Classes
c) Interface can only have public final variables

2) RunTime Polymorphism vs Compile time polymorphism
-  RunTime Polymorphism is method overriding 
 & Compiletime polymorphism is method overloading

3)Can I override constructor/static-method/main-method/abstract-method
a) Constructors cannot be overridden.
b) static method  cannot be overridden.
c)  main   method  cannot be overridden.
d) abstract  method must be be overridden.

4)Can I overload constructor/static-method/main-method/abstract-method
a) Constructors can  be overridden.
b) static method  can be overridden.
c)  main   method  can be overridden.
d) abstract  method cannot   be be overridden.

5)Comparator vs comparable
- Comparator is used to comp
- For Comparable we will need to implement

6) Upcasting vs downcasting

7) Why we use String[] arg in main method? Why String[] not int[]?

8) What will be results of below
System.out.println(10+10+"The String");
System.out.println("The String"+10+10);

9) What is Pojo Class:
They typically have private fields with public getter and setter methods.


10) keywords
a) this vs super
b) private, default, public, protected
c) volatile
d ) synchronized : The synchronized keyword in Java is used to control access to a block of code or method by multiple threads. 
It ensures that only one thread can execute the synchronized code at a time, preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety. 


############# Memory Managemnent ############# 
Refer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yKxJjYXZ0A

1) Memory Management: 
 a) Speed: Which is faster- Stack is faster
 b) Size: which have more memory- Heap is faster
 c) where is memory allocated for local variables, class methods, reference variables? - Stack
 d) where is memory allocated for instance variables of each object ? - Stack
 e) where is memory allocated for static variables  and static methods--> metaspace
 f) is metaspace part of heap--no

1) What is garbage collector? 
Garbage collector destroy objects which have The garbage collector automatically identifies and frees up memory that is no longer being used by the program. 
This contrasts with manual memory management, where the programmer must explicitly allocate and deallocate memory.

12) what is String pool?


String s1 = "Java";
String s2 = "Java";
String s3 = new String("Java");
String s4 = new String("Java").intern();
System.out.println((s1 == s2)+", String are equal."); // true
System.out.println((s1 == s3)+", String are not equal."); // false
System.out.println((s1 == s4)+", String are equal."); // true


14) SingleTon Class
