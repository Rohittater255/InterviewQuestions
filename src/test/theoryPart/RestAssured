a)By Pass SSL: 
        RestAssured.useRelaxedHTTPSValidation();

b) Use SSL
        RestAssured.config().sslConfig(new SSLConfig()
            .keyStore("path/to/keystore.jks", "password")
            .trustStore("path/to/truststore.jks", "password"));

c) Set connection/socket timeout
        RestAssured.config().
                httpClient(HttpClientConfig.httpClientConfig().
                        setParam("http.socket.timeout", 1000).

Connection timeout: A connection timeout is the maximum amount of time that the program is willing to wait
to setup a connection to another process. You aren't getting or posting any application data
at this point, just establishing the connection, itself.

Socket timeout: A socket timeout is the timeout when waiting for individual packets.
 It's a common misconception that a socket timeout is the timeout to receive the full response.
 So if you have a socket timeout of 1 second, and a response comprised of 3 IP packets,
  where each response packet takes 0.9 seconds to arrive, for a total response time of 2.7 seconds,
   then there will be no timeout.
