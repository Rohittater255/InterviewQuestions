- Define Agile?
  Agile is a methodology in software development that emphasizes iterative progress,
  collaboration, and flexibility. Instead of working on a project from start to finish in one go,
  Agile breaks the process into smaller, manageable chunks called sprints.
  Each sprint typically lasts 1-4 weeks and results in a potentially shippable product increment.

- Define Scrum And Sprint?
  Scrum is an Agile framework used for managing and completing complex projects.
  It emphasizes teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal.
  The Scrum framework includes roles such as Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team,
  ceremonies like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, sprint reviews, and retrospectives,
  and artifacts such as the product backlog and sprint backlog.

  A Sprint is a set period (usually 1-4 weeks) during which specific work has to be completed and
  made ready for review. Each sprint begins with a planning meeting and ends with a review and retrospective.
  The goal is to build a usable product increment at the end of each sprint.

- What is the estimation techniques in Sprint?
    Planning Poker: Team members use cards to estimate the effort for tasks, revealing their cards simultaneously to encourage discussion and consensus.
    T-shirt Sizes: Tasks are categorized into sizes like XS, S, M, L, and XL to represent effort, making it quick and easy to understand.
    Three-Point Estimation: Uses three values—optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely—to calculate an average estimate.
    Bucket System: Similar to Planning Poker but with a larger group, this method uses buckets (categories) to place tasks and reach consensus.
